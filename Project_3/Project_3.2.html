            <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
    
        <p>The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) is the deity of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or Pastafarianism, a parodic new religious movement that promotes a light-hearted view of religion.[3] It originated in opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools in the United States. According to adherents, Pastafarianism (a portmanteau of pasta and Rastafarianism) is a "real, legitimate religion, as much as any other".[4] It has received some limited recognition as such.[5][6][7][8][9]</p>

        <p>The "Flying Spaghetti Monster" was first described in a satirical open letter written by Bobby Henderson in 2005 to protest the Kansas State Board of Education decision to permit teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in state school science classes.[10] In the letter, Henderson demanded equal time in science classrooms for "Flying Spaghetti Monsterism", alongside intelligent design and evolution.[11] After Henderson published the letter on his website, the Flying Spaghetti Monster rapidly became an Internet phenomenon and a symbol of opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in state schools.[12]</p>

        <p>Pastafarian tenets (generally satires of creationism) are presented on Henderson's Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster website (where he is described as "prophet"), and are also elucidated in <em>The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em>, written by Henderson in 2006, and in <em>The Loose Canon</em>, the Holy Book of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The central creation myth is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe after drinking heavily. Pirates are revered as the original Pastafarians.[13] The FSM community congregates at Henderson's website to share ideas about and sightings of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and display crafts representing images of it.[4]</p>

        <p>Because of its popularity and exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as a more modern version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot" target="_blank">Russell's Teapot</a>—an argument that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon those who make unfalsifiable claims, not on those who reject them. Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in Polk County, Florida, where they played a role in dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.[14] Pastafarianism has received praise from the scientific community and criticism from proponents of intelligent design.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>

            <p>In January 2005,[15] Bobby Henderson, a 24-year-old[16] Oregon State University physics graduate, sent an open letter regarding the Flying Spaghetti Monster to the Kansas State Board of Education.[12][17][18] In that letter, Henderson satirized creationism by professing his belief that whenever a scientist carbon-dates an object, a supernatural creator that closely resembles spaghetti and meatballs is there "changing the results with His Noodly Appendage". Henderson argued that his beliefs were just as valid as intelligent design, and called for equal time in science classrooms alongside intelligent design and evolution.[11] The letter was sent prior to the Kansas evolution hearings as an argument against the teaching of intelligent design in biology classes.[12] Henderson, describing himself as a "concerned citizen" representing more than ten million others, argued that intelligent design and his belief that "the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster" were equally valid.[12] In his letter, he noted,</p>

            <blockquote>I think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country, and eventually the world; one third time for Intelligent Design, one third time for Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence.
            <cite>— Bobby Henderson[11]</cite></blockquote>

            <p>According to Henderson, since the intelligent design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster.[19] Henderson explained, "I don't have a problem with religion. What I have a problem with is religion posing as science. If there is a god and he's intelligent, then I would guess he has a sense of humor".[10][20]</p>

            <p>In May 2005, having received no reply from the Kansas State Board of Education, Henderson posted the letter on his website, gaining significant public interest.[4][15] Shortly thereafter, Pastafarianism became an Internet phenomenon.[10][19] Henderson published the responses he then received from board members.[21] Three board members, all of whom opposed the curriculum amendments, responded positively; a fourth board member responded with the comment "It is a serious offense to mock God".[22] Henderson has also published the significant amount of hate mail, including death threats, that he has received.[23][24] Within one year of sending the open letter, Henderson received thousands of emails on the Flying Spaghetti Monster, eventually totaling over 60,000,[25] of which he has said that "about 95 percent have been supportive, while the other five percent have said I am going to hell".[10] During that time, his site garnered tens of millions of hits.[25]</p>

            <p>The FSM version of the "Jesus fish" emblem has become accepted as the symbol of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The symbol was originally created by readers of the Boing Boing web site in 2005.[26][27]</p>

            <p>As word of Henderson's challenge to the board spread, his website and cause received more attention and support. The satirical nature of Henderson's argument made the Flying Spaghetti Monster popular with bloggers as well as humor and Internet culture websites.[28] The Flying Spaghetti Monster was featured on websites such as Boing Boing, Something Awful, Uncyclopedia, and Fark. Moreover, an International Society for Flying Spaghetti Monster Awareness and other fan sites emerged.[29] As public awareness grew, the mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Flying Spaghetti Monster became a symbol for the case against intelligent design in public education.[12][30][31] The open letter was printed in several major newspapers, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Chicago Sun-Times,[25] and received worldwide press attention.[32] Henderson himself was surprised by its success, stating that he "wrote the letter for [his] own amusement as much as anything".[19]</p>

            <p>In August 2005, in response to a challenge from a reader, Boing Boing announced a $250,000 prize—later raised to $1,000,000—of "Intelligently Designed currency" payable to any individual who could produce empirical evidence proving that Jesus is not the son of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.[33] It was modeled as a parody of a similar challenge issued by young-earth creationist Kent Hovind.[19][34]</p>

            <p>According to Henderson, newspaper articles on the Flying Spaghetti Monster attracted the attention of book publishers; he said that at one point, there were six publishers interested in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.[25] In November 2005, Henderson received an advance from Villard to write <em>The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em>.[35]</p>

            <p>In November 2005, the Kansas State Board of Education voted to allow criticisms of evolution, including language about intelligent design, as part of testing standards.[36] On February 13, 2007, the board voted 6–4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. This was the fifth time in eight years that the board had rewritten the standards on evolution.[37]</p>

            <h2>Tenets</h2>
            <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>

            <p>With millions, if not thousands, of devout worshipers, the Church of the FSM is widely considered a legitimate religion, even by its opponents—mostly fundamentalist Christians, who have accepted that our God has larger balls than theirs.</p>

            <p>Although Henderson has stated that "the only dogma allowed in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the rejection of dogma", some general beliefs are held by Pastafarians.[4] Henderson proposed many Pastafarian tenets in reaction to common arguments by proponents of intelligent design.[38] These "canonical beliefs" are presented by Henderson in his letter to the Kansas State Board of Education,[11] The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and on Henderson's website, where he is described as a "prophet".[39] They tend to satirize creationism.[19]</p>

            <h3>Creation</h3>
            <p><em>See also: Omphalos hypothesis</em></p>
            <p>The central creation myth is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe "after drinking heavily". According to these beliefs, the Monster's intoxication was the cause for a flawed Earth. Furthermore, according to Pastafarianism, all evidence for evolution was planted by the Flying Spaghetti Monster in an effort to test the faith of Pastafarians—parodying certain biblical literalists.[40] When scientific measurements such as radiocarbon dating are taken, the Flying Spaghetti Monster "is there changing the results with His Noodly Appendage".[11]</p>

            <h3>Afterlife</h3>
            <p>The Pastafarian conception of Heaven includes a beer volcano and a stripper (or sometimes prostitute or paint stripper) factory.[39][41] The Pastafarian Hell is similar, except that the beer is stale and the strippers have sexually transmitted diseases.[42]</p>

            <h3>Pirates and global warming</h3>

                <img src="images/440px-PiratesVsTemp(en).svg.png" alt="chart showing that in 1820 there were 25,000 pirates and the global average temperature was 14.2 degrees C, while in 2000 there were 17 pirates and the global average temperature was 15.9 degrees C.">
                <figcaption>A misleading graph that is claimed to correlate the number of pirates with global temperature</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>According to Pastafarian beliefs, pirates are "absolute divine beings" and the original Pastafarians.[11] Furthermore, Pastafarians believe that the concept of pirates as "thieves and outcasts" is misinformation spread by Christian theologians in the Middle Ages. Instead, Pastafarians believe that they were "peace-loving explorers and spreaders of good will" who distributed candy to small children, adding that modern pirates are in no way similar to "the fun-loving buccaneers from history". In addition, Pastafarians believe that ghost pirates are responsible for all of the mysteriously lost ships and planes of the Bermuda Triangle. Pastafarians are among those who celebrate International Talk Like a Pirate Day on September 19.[43]</p>

            <p>The inclusion of pirates in Pastafarianism was part of Henderson's original letter to the Kansas State Board of Education, in an effort to illustrate that correlation does not imply causation.[44] Henderson presented the argument that "global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s".[11] A deliberately misleading graph accompanying the letter (with numbers humorously disordered on the x-axis) shows that as the number of pirates decreased, global temperatures increased. This parodies the suggestion from some religious groups that the high numbers of disasters, famines, and wars in the world is due to the lack of respect and worship toward their deity. In 2008, Henderson interpreted the growing pirate activities at the Gulf of Aden as additional support, pointing out that Somalia has "the highest number of pirates and the lowest carbon emissions of any country".[45]</p>

            <h3>Holidays</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>Pastafarian beliefs extend into lighthearted religious ceremony. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day.[19] Prayers are concluded with a final declaration of affirmation, "R'amen" (or "rAmen"); the term is a parodic portmanteau of the terms "Amen" and "Ramen", referring to a Japanese noodle dish and to the "noodly appendages" of their deity.[10] The celebration of "Pastover" requires consuming large amounts of pasta, and during "Ramendan", only Ramen noodles are consumed; International Talk Like a Pirate Day is observed as a holiday.[46][47]</p>

            <p>Around the time of Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa, Pastafarians celebrate a vaguely defined holiday named "Holiday". Holiday does not take place on "a specific date so much as it is the Holiday season, itself". According to Henderson, as Pastafarians "reject dogma and formalism", there are no specific requirements for Holiday. Pastafarians celebrate Holiday in any manner they please.[48] Pastafarians interpret the increasing usage of "Happy Holidays", rather than more traditional greetings (such as "Merry Christmas"), as support for Pastafarianism.[48] In December 2005, George W. Bush's White House Christmas greeting cards wished people a happy "holiday season",[49] leading Henderson to write the President a note of thanks, including a "fish" emblem depicting the Flying Spaghetti Monster for his limousine or plane.[50] Henderson also thanked Walmart for its use of the phrase.[51]</p>
